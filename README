==========
PyMagellan
==========

pymagellan is a python interface to the map format used by Magellan GPS devices. The code is rougly
based on the specification of the Magellan map format from the mapsend_format Yahoo group. 
It also provides a command line tool for converting data from OpenStreetMap.

The produced maps should work fine with the Magellan Meridian, Sportrack, Explorist and Triton series GPS 
devices from Magellan Navigation. 

Note, the code is in pre-alpha state and is not extensively tested yet. Use at your own risk.

PyMagellan is is released under the GPL v2 license

Future improvements and features (in order of importance)
---------------------------------------------------------
* Write a nicer and complete rule file (the distributed one is not more than a simple example)
* Generation of polygons from coastlines
* Improve speed
* Custom colours (right now there is only a limited selection of colors)
* Possibility to create base maps 
* Routable maps
